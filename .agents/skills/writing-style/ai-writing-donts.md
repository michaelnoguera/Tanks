# AI-Writing Don'ts

Use this as the final prose pass for agent-written text. Delete first.
Rewrite only when the sentence carries a fact, decision, result, constraint, or
caveat.

## Use Plain Technical English

Apply Orwell's rules of writing and Simplified Technical English (ASD-STE100).
Prefer short, active sentences, common concrete words, one action or claim per
sentence, and one term for each concept. Cut words that add no fact. Avoid stale
metaphors and idioms. Keep specialized terms when they improve precision, and
explain unfamiliar terms. If a term's origin or exact meaning is unclear, omit
it or research it until you can explain it to other readers. Repeating jargon
solely because another source used it hides uncertainty and spreads undefined
language. Break a rule when following it would make the prose less clear or
accurate.

## Test With A Cold Reader

For durable prose or any text that must stand alone, give a context-less
subagent only the finished draft and its intended audience. Do not provide the
conversation, source notes, diff, or author intent. Ask what terms, referents,
claims, or causal links a first-time reader cannot recover from the text.
Fix concrete gaps with the smallest local edit. Extra context can hide the main
claim and overload a first-time reader. Narrow or reshape a claim when its full
explanation would interrupt the text; put optional background behind a link. Do
not add conversation history that the intended audience does not need, and do
not turn personal style preferences into findings.

## Cut Empty Sentences

Delete a sentence when removing it loses no information. Common waste:

- bridge prose: `The main change is...`, `Stepping back...`, `What this means is...`
- importance claims: `Importantly`, `It is worth noting`, `This is the key point`
- stage directions: `Let's dive in`, `Here is a summary`, `In this section...`
- effort narration: `After extensive investigation...`
- generic conclusions, recaps, future-work sections, and chatbot sign-offs
- prose that restates a heading, list length, table, diff, or visible structure

Start with the fact. End when the useful information ends.

## Ban Stock Contrast

Remove rhetorical templates built around a staged opposition:

- `X, not Y`
- `not X, but Y`
- `not just X, but also Y`
- `more than X`
- `the question is no longer X; it is Y`
- `the real story is X`
- `what matters is X`
- `rather than Y` when no real comparison is being made

State X directly. Split real comparisons into plain claims.

Bad:

> The issue is not query execution, but the metadata path.

Better:

> Metadata loading takes 12 seconds. Query execution takes 400 ms.

Bad:

> The change improves reliability, not just performance.

Better:

> Median latency fell 18%. Failed retries fell from 7 to 0.

Grammatical negation is fine when the negative fact matters: `The ablation has
not run.` A measured comparison is fine when both sides matter.

## Require Evidence

- Name the code path, configuration, issue, artifact, measurement, or unknown.
- Replace adjectives with evidence. Delete `robust`, `powerful`, `seamless`,
  `significant`, `crucial`, and `pivotal` unless a concrete result follows.
- Say `we have not tested X` when evidence is missing.
- Keep prose consistent with tables, code, and current behavior.
- Remove stale explanations after the implementation changes.
- Use one precise term for one technical object.

## Avoid LLM Cadence

- Skip adjective trios and forced rules of three.
- Skip `Additionally`, `Furthermore`, `Moreover`, `Importantly`, and `Notably`.
- Skip `landscape`, `ecosystem`, `interplay`, `tapestry`, `testament`, `delve`,
  `showcase`, `underscore`, and `foster`.
- Avoid em-dash asides. Make the point a sentence or delete it.
- Avoid bold labels, takeaway boxes, and decorative headings.
- Do not rotate synonyms for the same object.

## Score Every Paragraph

Each paragraph must contain a concrete result, setup, decision, constraint, or
caveat. Rewrite or delete paragraphs that only frame significance or smooth a
transition.

Ask of every sentence:

1. What information disappears if I delete it?
2. Can I replace it with a number, named fact, decision, or explicit unknown?
3. Does it still describe the current code and evidence?
4. Could it appear unchanged in a random software announcement?

Delete sentences that fail this check.

## Prefer Plain Rewrites

- `The main change is that retries are bounded.` → `Retries stop after five attempts.`
- `This highlights a scalability problem.` → `Registration takes 1.2 seconds for 100 workers.`
- `The current state is much clearer.` → Name the resolved and open questions.
- `This is procedural progress.` → `The code is ready. The ablation has not run.`
- `The configuration has three parts:` → Start the list.

Finish with a search for stock contrast, bridge phrases, unsupported adjectives,
and stale claims. Prefer a shorter accurate document.
